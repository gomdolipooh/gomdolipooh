## Introduce Myself 😊

<div align="center" style="font-size: 100%;">
 
 ### Greetings! I'm a fourth-year student majoring in Internet of Things, currently studying in South Korea. 🌟<br>

 ### I thrive on challenges and consistently achieve my goals through determination and hard work. 💡<br>

 ### During my military service, I pondered over how to make the most of my university years,<br>
 ### and I committed to exploring my interests for at least a year. 🌱

 ### 1️⃣ In my second year, my fascination with entrepreneurship led me to secure funding of $15,000
   ### to develop a product and delve into marketing. 💼

 ### 2️⃣ Throughout my third year, I immersed myself in various competitions within my field, <br>
 ###   developing two successful apps and earning accolades. 🏆

 ### 3️⃣ As I enter my final year, I'm eager to showcase the skills I've honed thus far. 🚀

 ### Now, as a fourth-year student, I'm enthusiastic about broadening my horizons through an internship opportunity in the United States. 🌎
