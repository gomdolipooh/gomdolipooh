## Introduce Myself 📖

<div align="center">
Greetings! I'm a fourth-year student majoring in Internet of Things, currently studying in South Korea.

I thrive on challenges and consistently achieve my goals through determination and hard work.

During my military service, I pondered over how to make the most of my university years,
and I committed to exploring my interests for at least a year.

In my second year, my fascination with entrepreneurship led me to secure funding of $15,000 
to develop a product and delve into marketing.

Throughout my third year, I immersed myself in various competitions within my field, 
developing two successful apps and earning accolades.

As I enter my final year, I'm eager to showcase the skills I've honed thus far.

Now, as a fourth-year student, I'm enthusiastic about broadening my horizons through an internship opportunity in the United States.
