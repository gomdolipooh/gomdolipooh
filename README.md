## Introduce Myself ðŸ“–
<div align="center">
  "Hello, I am a fourth-year student majoring in Internet of Things in South Korea.

  I love taking on challenges, and I'm someone who always accomplishes what I set my mind to.

  During my spare time in the military, I contemplated how to spend my university life, and I made a commitment to try things I wanted to do for at least a year. 
  In my second year, I was interested in entrepreneurship, and I received funding of 15 million won to develop a product and even ventured into marketing. 
  In my third year, I focused on participating in various competitions related to my major. Over the course of a year, I developed two apps and was able to win awards. 
  In my fourth year, I aimed to showcase the skills I've acquired so far.

  Now, as a fourth-year student, I am eager to expand my abilities through an internship in the United States."
